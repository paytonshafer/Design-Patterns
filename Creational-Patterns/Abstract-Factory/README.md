# Factory Method Pattern
This directory contains examples of the Abstract Factory design pattern implemented in TypeScript. The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families objects, related by a high-level concept, without specifying their concrete classes. This allows for families to have varients and it helps to ensure that the created objects are compatible with each other (meaning there is no mixing up of varients). The pattern has an interface for creating the families of objects. Concrete implementations create the specific variations of the object family.

If at any point you would like to obtain and run these files refer to the root `README.md` found [here](../../).

## Conceptual Example
The conceptual example can be found in `conceptual.ts` and ran from `conceptual.js`. The TypeScript files contains the code and explanations of what each element does in the design pattern.

## Real-World Example
TBD
